### Description

Now you can quickly integrate the Sensirion SEN6x environmental sensor node into your microcontroller or microcomputer project, with no soldering or fiddly breadboarding - thanks to this here Adafruit SEN6x Adapter Breakout (for SEN66 and friends). We covered the awesome Sensirion SEN66 environmental sensor nodes on EYE ON NPI a while ago; it's an awesome all-in-one air quality sensor, but it has the annoyance that it requires 3V power/logic, and it has a special cable connection.

This adapter breakout will make an instant friendship with all SEN6x boards, thanks to a JST GH-compatible connector in the middle so that you can plug a 6-pin GH cable directly between your SEN6x and this adapter. In the middle is a clean 3.3V regulator and level shifter, so you can use this module whether you're using 3.3V or 5V power and logic. Then you can use any ol' STEMMA QT cable to plug into your Metro, Feather, QT Py, Raspberry Pi, etc, etc. I2C port.

Once you've got it plugged together, you can run Sensirion's Arduino library or Raspberry Pi Python library to read temperature, humidity, VOC, Particulate Matter PM1 / PM2.5 / PM4, and PM10. (NOx reading is also available on the SEN55)

Please note: this board does NOT come with a JST GH-compatible cable NOR a SEN6x sensor! You can [pick up the cable here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5754), and a [SEN6x from DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/product-highlight/s/sensirion/environmental-sensor-node-sen6x).
